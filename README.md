# CNN_Model_for_Parkinson_Disease_Detection
 A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for Parkinson's Disease detection is a deep learning architecture designed to analyze medical data, typically in the form of images, to identify and diagnose Parkinson's Disease. 

# Parkinson's disease:
Parkinson's disease is a complex and progressive neurological disorder that affects the central nervous system. It is characterized by a wide range of motor and non-motor symptoms. This disease primarily occurs due to the loss of a specific type of brain cells that produce a neurotransmitter called dopamine. Dopamine is essential for transmitting signals within the brain that control movement and coordination.

# Project Overview:
Parkinson's Disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Early diagnosis of this condition is vital for timely intervention and improved quality of life. Our college mini project, "Parkinson's Disease Detection using CNN," is a step toward achieving this goal. We've developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that leverages the power of deep learning and image analysis to detect Parkinson's disease from hand-drawn spiral and wave images

# Key Features:

Cutting-Edge Technology: Our project employs state-of-the-art CNNs, a subfield of deep learning, to automatically extract relevant features from hand-drawn images for precise disease detection.

Early Diagnosis: By providing a quick and accurate diagnostic tool, our project aids in the early identification of Parkinson's disease, enabling timely medical intervention and better patient outcomes.

User-Friendly Interface: We've created an intuitive and user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to effortlessly upload their hand-drawn images for analysis. Our goal is to make this tool accessible to a wide range of users, including healthcare professionals and patients.

Educational Value: As a college project, our code is open source, making it an educational resource for students and enthusiasts interested in the intersection of healthcare and artificial intelligence. We encourage others to learn from and contribute to our work.
